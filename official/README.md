# CS 296-25 Honors Project

## How to Play

Collect the components of your ECE 385 final project in this maze riddled with riddles. The correct answer
to each riddle will lead to a UIUC themed location with a different component and riddle. An incorrect answer
will take the player to an undefined location to be sent home to restart the maze. When all items have been 
collected then the "make" command should be used to create the final project. After that, the player should
return to the ECEB to submit the project and finish the game.
